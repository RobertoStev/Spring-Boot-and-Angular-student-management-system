<h1> <b> Spring Boot and Angular CRUD application for managing students </b>b> </h1>

<p>This application enables CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations using Spring Boot and Angular.</p>

In the following we will take a look on how this application works/

1. When we run the application on this url: http://localhost:4200/students
We can see the list of all students that are currently in my MySQL database.
For each student we have: index, first name, last name, email and in the last column we have actions that we can perform on that student
